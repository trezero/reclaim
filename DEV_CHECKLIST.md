- [ ] Executable runs from `src-tauri/target/release/`
- [ ] Bundle size < 20MB

---

## 🔌 Backend Integration

### Python Backend
- [ ] FastAPI backend running (`uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`)
- [ ] Backend accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- [ ] `/docs` endpoint shows Swagger UI
- [ ] CORS configured for frontend

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `GET /analyze` returns drive data
- [ ] `GET /plans` returns 3 plans
- [ ] `GET /plan/{id}` returns plan details
- [ ] `POST /execute` starts execution
- [ ] `WS /progress/{id}` streams updates
- [ ] `GET /settings` returns settings
- [ ] `POST /settings` saves settings

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] API calls succeed from frontend
- [ ] Error states display correctly
- [ ] Loading states shown
- [ ] WebSocket connects and receives messages
- [ ] Settings persist across reloads

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Fresh install works
- [ ] Dashboard displays real drive data
- [ ] Click "Get AI Recommendations" loads plans
- [ ] Select plan shows details
- [ ] Execute plan shows progress
- [ ] Settings save and reload
- [ ] Error handling works (stop backend, see error)

### User Flows
- [ ] Flow 1: Dashboard → Plans → Details → Execute → Success
- [ ] Flow 2: Dashboard → Plans → Details → Cancel
- [ ] Flow 3: Dashboard → Settings → Save → Dashboard
- [ ] Flow 4: Execution → Failure → Rollback
- [ ] Flow 5: Backend offline → Error shown → Retry

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No drives detected
- [ ] All drives healthy (no imbalance)
- [ ] Empty top consumers list
- [ ] No plans available
- [ ] WebSocket disconnects mid-execution
- [ ] Invalid settings input
